# AffineInvariantSamplers

Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02987

mcmc samplers are all in `samplers.py`

Run experiments (can first set a small number of iterations first, to see how the output looks like)
`experiments_Gaussian.py`
`experiments_ring.py`
`experiments_Allen-Cahn.py`


These are for generating figures in the paper, based on obtained samples using the above .py experiments (in particular, the slurm version which is run on cpu clusters)
